      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm 20 years old, and since I was a teenager I dedicate my time and effort to the technology area. I started my career as a computer technician in a store in Brazil near my old home. I worked in the area for 7 years, but during that time I also worked as a cell phone technician, network and internet installer and commercial automation assistant, I became manager of this company at 17 but at 20 I decided to leave the company to change countries pursue a career as a programmer. I have always been passionate about the area and with my exclusive dedication, I have the willingness and flexibility to work in different segments. I want to increase my skills as a programmer, grow professionally and make a difference wherever I am.      </p>
